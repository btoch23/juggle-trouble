## Overview

Juggle Trouble is a simple game inspired by the flash games I used to play as a kid and built with HTML, CSS, and vailla Javascript.

Use the arrow or WASD keys to move the paddle and keep the ball in the air for as long as possible! A counter in the top left corner tracks your score and a counter in the top right corner tracks your lives.
